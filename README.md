# Day 1: Blockchain Briefing
#### `ledgers`
conflicting/inconsistent ledgers. The discrepancy is a real problem, if we don't have some to settle it.
Is there a shared, incorruptible, secure and authoritative ledger? where the ledger becomes the source 
of truth, and that because it includes history. We could make more transactions, whether small or large or 
whatever.

And this magical ledger doesn't just have to be between two parties. We can make it to 100, and public to all.
This is exact what Blockchain does.

#### `distributed ledger`
the entire point of this technology is to create a distributed digital ledger. A shared network of information that is duplicated and across many differenct computers. And when any person in this adds a new entry, or a new transaction to this 
ledger, it is automatically copied across all the different participants, that are called as different nodes in this system.

And with the blockchain that's used for Bitcoin for example, and it has all the transactions for that digital currency.
There are actually tens of thousands of different computers, that have a copy of the same data. And what makes blockchain very different from a conventional database is that this distributed ledger isn't owned by just one personal organization. There is no single administrator. Nobody is incharge, because that data isn't only on one specific computer in one server room in one company. It is distributed. And it is decentralized.

Everyone is a peer, and new transaction can be added at any point in this network and they will be automatically copied peer-to-peer. But it's this ability of blockchain to act as a single shared soruce of truth that works incredibly well for financial transactions, but can also make it useful for so much more.

Blockchain is append-only. The blocks in that chain is immutable. If we found any transaction with invalid values and we will not change remove them or update them directly. We must add the new transaction to overwrite the invalid values to adjust them.

# Day 2: Cryptographic & hashing

#### `Cryptographic hash`
cryptographic hashing or just hashing, is a commmon task in programming.
We are already compfortable with the purposes and benefits of hashing. Think of the word hash as we use it in cooking, like corn beef hash. A hash is where you take some ingredients, chop them up into little bits, mix it all up, and get the result.
That's kind of what we're doing here. We will put some calculations on thoese different pieces, and then combine them together
to end up with a small value. A result that often looks smaller and very meaningless and random, but it was actually based on that original data.

# Day 3: Smart Contract
We could instead store a contract, an actual agreement, and this doen't just mean
a digitalized PDF. It it a mini program with a predefined list of rules to very specifically control the business transactions. And what makes a smart contract smart is that once on the blockchain, it will be executed automatically, based on those rules. Because smart contact is written in code, it requires no intermediary to make them happen, they're fully automactic. Like the other things in blockchain, once it's placed there, it can't be changed.

> **IBM** "Smart contracts are digital contracts store on a blockchain that are automatically executed when predetermined terms and conditions are met. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can immediately certain of the outcome without any intermediary's involvement or time loss."
<https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts>


> **Microsoft** "a smart contract is a program that's stored inside a blockchain. Smart contracts extend blockchain from data to code. They represent an agreement between parties. The agreement is coded, and when an action happens, the code runs and provides a response. All of the terms and conditions of the contracts are programmatically defined. ... Smart contracts run on their own, send events that trigger state transistions, and call functions. They're pefect for blockchain technology because they allow people who don't know one another to do business in a securely specified way that requires no middleman. ... Smart contracts are most commonly used with Ethereum. It allows smart contacts to be defined to help facilitates the transfer of digital assets, like ether."

> 

> **wikipedia** "A smart contract is a computer program or transaction protocol that is intended to automatically execute, control or document legally relevant events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an agreement. The objectives of smart contracts are the reduction of need for trusted intermediators, arbitrations costs, fraud losses, as well as the reduction of malicious and accidental exceptions. Smart contracts are commonly associated with cryptocurrencies, and the smart contracts introduced by Ethereum are generally considered a fundamental building block for decentralized finance(DeFi) applications." <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract>
